# Forcasting Sticker Sales Kaggle Competition

This repository contains our models for the "Forecasting Sticker Sales" Kaggle Competition. Here, the Machine Learning task is to forecast sticker sales in different countries (At Kaggle, they take stickers seriously!).

The repository is organized into 4 main notebook:

1. Dataset Exploration: Contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the original dataset. 
2. Feature Engineering: Transforms features into a more explanatory space, producing `transformed_features.csv`
3. Model training: Uses `transformed_features.csv` to try a variety of ML models.
4. Evaluation: Uses `results.csv` to analyse the errors of different models proposed.
